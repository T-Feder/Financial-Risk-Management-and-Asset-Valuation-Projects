# Financial-Risk-Management-and-Asset-Valuation-Projects
This repository contains three in-depth projects focusing on financial risk management and asset valuation:

**Options Pricing and Hedging**: Implementation of Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo methods to price options, analyze Greeks, and develop hedging strategies.  
**Bonds and Yields Analysis**: Valuation of bonds, computation of spot and forward rates, yield-to-maturity analysis, and hedging strategies using duration and convexity.  
**Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (CVaR)**: Application of parametric, non-parametric, and hybrid approaches for portfolio risk assessment, including Monte Carlo simulations and stress testing during market crises.
